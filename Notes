Things I've learnt doing this website:

CSS Grid & Flexbox:
I used this challenge to practice as much as I could of grid and flexbox because I think this is going to be a really useful tool in the future.

Fixed header:
Problems: At first I couldn't get the header to be the size of the page, but it was fixed by using `width:100%.
I also had a problem with my icon going over the header instead of scrolling behind it. I learnt how to use z-index (which defines the order of the elements in the z axis) and I fixed the problem..

Embed links:
I used embed links to put Jack's favourite playlist and the game on Scratch.
Problems: I couldn't find a way to put the game on the website but I did some research and ta-da!

Facebook Comment plugin:
I like to know I can use it in case I have a blog in the future. And because I posted his game it's nice that people can comment.

Hide text:
I learnt how to hide texts (and they appear when you hover) so I could hide the answer to joke.

Icon picture rotation and changing colour:
I had seen this in a website before and I wanted to learn how to do it, so that was fun!

Change number of column:
Problem: I was happy with my website but it was bothering me the content looked weird in a smaller screen. So I studied a bit of mediaquery and finally it looks the way I wanted.
