## Website Challenge

### Overview

For your first project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about your pair partner using HTML and CSS.

### Outcome

- a single web page created with HTML and CSS

- a profile describing your client

- a short 1-page README.md file alongside it which describes how you went about the project (your thoughts, research, plans, and justification for decisions)

# About my project

I've built a single web page, using HTML and CSS. I like the minimalist style and also a bit monochrome. I learnt a lot while building the page and it was so much fun doing my mini projects in the page. While I was doing my reseach I kept a diary in my notes so I could share my process:
 

### Things I've learnt doing this website:

#### CSS Grid & Flexbox:

That was the very first thing I've done in my page. I used CSS Grid to basically build the skelleton of my website and I used this challenge to practice as much as I could of grid and flexbox because I think this is going to be a really useful tool in the future.

#### Fixed header:

Well that was difficult to figure out, because at first I couldn't get the header to be the size of the page, but it was fixed by using `width:100%` and also setting a max-width.

I also had a problem with my icon going over the header instead of scrolling behind it. I learnt how to use z-index (which defines the order of the elements in the z axis) and I had the problem fixed.

#### Embed links:

I used embed links to put Jack's favourite playlist on the page but I really wanted to put the game on Scratch he had made for the application process of School of Code, I did some research and ta-da! It works!

#### Hide text:

I learnt how to hide texts (they appear when you hover) so I could hide the answer to the joke that my client wanted on the page.

#### Icon picture:

I had seen this in a website before and I wanted to learn how to do it, so that was fun! The icon picture is round by using `border-radius=50%;` and it's b&w like the other pictures. But when you hover, the icon rotates 360 and it goes back to its original colour.

#### Media Query:

That has got to be my favourite. I was happy with my website but it was bothering me the content looked weird in a smaller screen. So I studied a bit of mediaquery and finally it looks the way I wanted. So when you open the website in a mobile or if you resize the screen on the browser the whole page changes from 3 columns to only 1!

For the media query I changed from grid to flexbox and I also hid all the picture (just because I can!)
